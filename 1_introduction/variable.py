# ⁡⁣⁣⁢what is variable⁡

# variable is like container or box that store some data


# example

a = 'kaushik'
age  = 22
young = True

# explain
# name → stores the text "Kaushik"
# age → stores the number 22
# ypung → stores true


# ⁡⁣⁣⁢how to create variable⁡

x = 10
y = 11.40

# No need to mention type (like int or string) —
# 👉 Python automatically understands it.
# it means dynamic type

# ⁡⁣⁣⁢rules for variable name ⁡

# valid ✅
name = "John"
age1 = 25
_total = 100


# invalid
# ⁡⁢⁣⁢1name = "John"   # cannot start with a number
# my-name = "Mac"  # no hyphen (-)
# class = "A"      # can't use keywords⁡

a = b = c = 10
print(a, b, c)

# out put =10,10,10
